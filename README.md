# How to run the application

I used Yarn to install the project's dependencies, but you can use npm either.

After all the initial installation step for NodeJS, Yarn or NPM. If you don't know how to, just google it.

Open he terminal on your folder and type 
```yarn install``` to install project's packages and ```node index.js``` to run the application.
